### ✔️ Korivash - Discord: Korivash#0001

⭐ My Name is Korivash and i am a small time self taught developer, I also do video editing on the side and upload them to my youtube channel.
other then that most my projects are FiveM Related but i have expanded into discord bots and more, i am always willing to learn new things or hunt down bugs, you can contact me on discord for a fast response if needed.

⭐ My current repos are private as i co-dev with people.
⭐ Public Repos will be coming soon as i work on them and feel comfortable releasing them in a professional matter.
